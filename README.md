# Plantopia

## Idea

A social media, specifically designed for people, who love plants.
The idea is to provide all the fundamental functionalities of a social
media platform. With this being covered, a variety of functions shall be
implemented that make the experience on this platform something special
for people, who know a lot about plants, who love to learn more and who
simply feel good, sharing their experiences with like-minded people.
To achieve this, there exists a roadmap with a lot of idea to make the
user experience as wholesome as possible.

## Technology

### User interface:
The project has been realized using Flutter and Dart, because these
technologies provide the necessary compatibility to distribute the
platform on android and iOS systems likewise, without writing specific
code for each of them. This enhances the speed of development and is
especially crucial for smaller teams who want to create prototypes of their
idea as fast as possible. Furthermore the technologies are also capable of
being used as a web-interface.

### Backend:
As the backend the service Firebase bas been used. Firebase is tightly connected
to Flutter and Darts which leads to a very easy and straight-forward integration
of the backend into the frontend code. Furthermore, Firebase provides a very good
performance and is completely free, as long as the traffic remains below a certain
threshold. If the product is planned to be scaled significantly, there ought to
be a different solution with more freedom and less costs. However, this does also
bring the risk of security, that has to be addressed.

### Launching the project:
It is recommended to use the newest Android Studio IDE, the newest FLutter SDK and to
set up flutter inside of Android Studio. Afterwards this code can be launched via a
virtual smartphone emulator.
